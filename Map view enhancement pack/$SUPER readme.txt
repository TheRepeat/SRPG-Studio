There are a bunch of nice plugins being used here:

Terrain Details, which shows the HP recovery (or damage) of terrain. Modified from LadyRena's Hide 0 Avoid script.
Doesn't have a readme because it doesn't need one.
 1. terrain-details.js

Detailed Unit Window, which expands on the unit window in the map view.
Check out the readme for more info.
 1. detailed-unit-window.js
 2. detailed-unit-window-med-v1.js **OR** detailed-unit-window-med-v2.js

Objective Window, which adds a new window to the map screen that allows you to display custom text.
Check out its readme, it is VERY important.
 1. map-objective-editable.js
 2. move-terrain.js

Warning Markers, which adds floating icons over dangerous enemies, units that can be spoken to, and supporters.
The readme is VERY important.
 1. warn-markers.js
 2. warn-markers-values.js

Better No-Animation Combat, which displays attack/accuracy/critical rate even when combat animations are turned off.
 1. detailed-easy-battle.js

Intuitive Seals, which hides units' stats on the combat forecast if the unit(s) in question will be sealed with the 
opponent's skill or weapon. Plug and play, doesn't require anything special.
 1. intuitive-seal.js

The plugins don't rely on each other, so you can pick and choose at your leisure, or use them all.
This collection is just to keep all of these enhancements together.
