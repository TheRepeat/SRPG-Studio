	WHAT ALL IS IN HERE?
There are a bunch of nice plugins included in this enhancement pack:

Terrain Details, which shows the HP recovery (or damage) of terrain. Modified from LadyRena's Hide 0 Avoid script.
Doesn't have a readme because it doesn't need one.
 1. R-terrain-details.js

Detailed Unit Window, which expands on the unit window in the map view.
Check out the readme for more info.
 1. 0_unitwindow-config.js
 2. R-unitwindow-large.js
 3. R-unitwindow-med.js

Objective Window, which adds a new window to the map screen that allows you to display custom text.
Check out its readme, it is VERY important.
 1. R-map-objective-editable.js
 2. R-move-terrain.js

Warning Markers, which adds floating icons over dangerous enemies, units that can be spoken to, and supporters.
Also adds an icon to units on the unit selection screen in battle prep who have Talk events during the chapter.
The readme is VERY important.
 1. 0_mcmagister-unit-state-animator.js
 2. R-warn-markers.js
 3. R-warn-markers-values.js
 4. R-prep-talk-markers.js

Better No-Animation Combat, which displays attack/accuracy/critical rate even when combat animations are turned off.
 1. R-detailed-easy-battle.js

Intuitive Seals, which hides units' stats on the combat forecast if the unit(s) in question will be sealed by the 
opponent's skill or weapon. Plug and play, doesn't require anything special.
 1. R-intuitive-seal.js

Show Weapon Type, which shows either the icon or the name of a weapon's type when checking its stats.
Plug and play, but has a handful of values you can edit in the file if you want to.
 1. R-show-weapontype.js

Item Drop Indicators, which places an icon over enemies that have an item they will drop.
Uses McMagister's Unit State Animator.
 1. R-drops-items.js

The plugins don't rely on each other, so you can pick and choose at your leisure, or use them all.
This collection is just to keep all of these enhancements together.
