Walking Map plugin (lets you move a character around with the arrow keys like in a JRPG), translated to English with a couple new features.

The instructions are all inside the files, at the top of each. I recommend opening them with an editor like Notepad++, VS Code, or Sublime Text.
"character-walking.js" in particular is the one you're probably here for.
